# Natural Language Processing of State of the Union Speeches

The State of the Union (SotU) is a annual message delivered by the president of the United States to the Congress. It is a chance for the president to speak to the nation and make a case for their agenda and current administration. The speech lays out the priorities for an administration and president, as well as the overall health, especially economic, of the nation. For this analysis we have the transcribed speeches of each SotU between 1945 and 2016. The time period covers 12 different presidents, 6 Democrats and 6 Republicans.
